Given a round-robin tournament of n teams, what is the probability that atleast one circle of parity can be formed?  

This is a Python notebook that generates results of an n team round robin tournament at random, makes a directed graph of the results, and runs simulations to check whether a COP can be formed in that scenario. The program involves the backtracking algorithm for checking the presence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a directed graph.
